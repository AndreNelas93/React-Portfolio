# Portfolio layout built using React 

This was my first attempt at developing a React app, after graduating from the bootcamp. The project is based on a tutorial.

The aim of this project was to put my hands on React in a code editor, after having finished Codecademy's React course.

The project was done in the beginning of April, and I've just pushed it whole to GH now.
